# insert clip tool aka porn corruptor
## whats it do
this takes two inputs, a `main` file and an `insert` file, then it
1. cuts the `main` file in two at a random point
2. extracts a random 3-5 second clip from the `insert` file
3. puts the extracted clip in between the two `main` file parts with a fade transition

## why did you make this
i had a brainwave when i was browsing /ck/ a few weeks ago. someone had inserted some random weird clip into the middle of a cooking video and it got me thinking: i wonder if we can create a new fetish by inserting 3 seconds of cooking clips into the middle of porn on /gif/ and spamming them
